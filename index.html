      <img src="assets/images/IMG_0588 (1).jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>As a teacher at a Title-1 school in the inner-city of Austin, I have been challenged in countless ways. At our school teachers are asked to be content masters, instructional perfectionists, life mentors, and in many ways parental figures to students who have been dealt a challenging hand in life.</p>

      <p>I’ve viewed my years as a teacher as a service to society, and while it’s a profession that has been Intensely positive for my maturation into adulthood, I am ready to move into the next phase of my professional life.</p>

      <p>I was highly successful as an educator, and I believe I will be highly successful as a critical thinking problem-solver.</p>
